( Kevin Lamarque/Reuters )\\nThe promise of this kind of spectacle is about one half of why Donald Trump was elected .\\nNew York City ’ s annual Shakespeare in the Park is the worst kind of theater . Washington ’ s annual government-shutdown drama is the second-worst kind .\\nI wrote off the alfresco performances in Central Park after the Public Theater decided that what Shakespeare ’ s A Winter ’ s Tale really needed was a political speech by Senator Schumer , who wandered onto the stage at one point — after Bill de Blasio ’ s campaign-rally speech but before the Muppets , if I recall that slightly surreal evening correctly — to make a few of his habitually banal political observations before shouting “ Vote Democratic ! ” and wandering off .\\nImprovisation is not the senator ’ s forte . When President Donald Trump surprised Senator Schumer and Representative Nancy Pelosi — the other half of the Democrats ’ noisome slapstick-comedy duo — by broadcasting their acrimonious Oval Office meeting , the anguine gentleman from New York was caught off-guard .\\nSenator Schumer and Representative Pelosi invoked the word “ shutdown ” as though it were a magical incantation . President Trump said that he ’ d be “ proud ” to shut down the government if he doesn ’ t get funding for a border wall . As Trump bellowed and berated the Democrats , “ Schumer sat staring forward and not meeting the president ’ s eyes , ” as CNBC put it . The promise of that kind of spectacle is about one half of why Donald Trump was elected .\\nThose of us who take a more miserly view of the enumerated powers of the federal government believe that it does not have very many legitimate jobs to do . Instead of doing a few things well , it does many , many , many things — badly . But if the federal apparatus serves any purpose at all , providing for national security — beginning with securing the borders — is it .\\nWashington should do its damned job . Which it will , once it has exhausted every other option . Republicans have the chance to take some of those options away .\\nDisorder is always undesirable in government . And this year ’ s installment of shutdown theater finds many different currents of chaos adjoined : an increasingly dysfunctional constitutional order in which the legislative branch has effectively abdicated and ceded much of its power to the executive ; a border that in practice is defended by very little more than strong language ; a broken congressional budgeting process in which the regular order of appropriations have been supplanted by a series of “ continuing resolutions , ” stopgap measures that have now been passed more than 100 times in this still-young century .\\nThat last one is worth thinking on some . From the Congressional Research Service :\\nBetween FY1977 and FY2016 ( excluding the four fiscal years in which all appropriations were enacted on time ) , over half of the regular appropriations bills for a fiscal year were enacted on time in only one instance ( FY1978 ) . In all other fiscal years , fewer than six regular appropriations acts were enacted on or before October 1 . In addition , in 14 out of the 40 years during this period , none of these regular appropriations bills were enacted prior to the start of the fiscal year . Nine of these fiscal years have occurred in the interval since FY2001 .\\nThe abandonment of what budget geeks refer to as “ regular order ” — the consideration , revision , and passage of a dozen or so separate appropriations bills moving through the ordinary congressional committee process — keeps Washington effectively in a state of constant fiscal emergency . That leads to a great deal of drama and much gnashing of teeth , but the stakes are almost trivial : Federal “ shutdowns ” are really nothing of the sort , with most of the essential functions of the government continuing uninterrupted . We don ’ t dock the aircraft carriers or put the nuclear arsenal in standby mode . The Obama administration made a great show of closing national parks , going so far as to surround the National Mall with barricades .\\nRepublicans used to fear being blamed for these things , a part of the more general Republican tendency to fear being blamed for things . But they have discovered that the political price for these acts of theater is pretty low . They are slow learners , but they learn — or at least they can , where there is a question of self-preservation . Mainly , shutdowns inconvenience the federal workers who get furloughed , which upsets their household finances . One feels for them . What ’ s rarely said aloud but surely appreciated by Republicans is that practically all of them are Democrats , as are the great majority of non-military government employees . If you have to hurt somebody , very few Republican voters are going to weep for the bureaucracy .\\nRepublicans ought to be the party of order . ( Ought ; they are not . ) But border security is an issue worth taking a stand on , even at the cost of a little ceremonial disorder . The politics are broadly on the side of those who wish to see the borders more adequately secured , and the issue will put Democrats in the position of defending illegal immigration — legal immigrants would not be much inconvenienced by a wall .\\nThe problem is that the Republicans have the right politics but the wrong policy . ( Often , the opposite is the case . ) Building a wall would bring some benefits and would present the Trump administration with an important symbolic victory , but it is at best an incomplete policy , and in some ways a bad one . For much of the U.S.-Mexico border , a wall is neither practical nor desirable , something that would be clear to the denizens of Washington if they spent much time on the parts of the border that are not within micturition distance of a Starbucks in San Diego .\\nPart of the problem with a wall is that it does things that we don ’ t want to do , such as necessitating the appropriation of private property along the border , interrupting access to water , etc . Those problems are mostly solvable . The bigger problem with a wall is that it does not do what we want it to do : cut off the flow of illegal immigrants . Most new illegal immigrants do not enter the United States by wading across the Rio Grande . They come legally on visas and fail to leave when required . You can build the wall ten feet higher or twenty feet higher , but unless you are going to build it high enough to cut off international air traffic , it will not solve the problem .\\nIf the Republicans are going to shut down the government over border security , they should do it on behalf of a better border-security agenda . The most important reform would be putting an electronic wall between would-be illegal workers and their employers through a robust , mandatory program of employment-eligibility verification . And then there ’ s the mundane , tedious work of everyday law enforcement : Raiding a few construction sites will net a few illegal drywall installers , but if you really want to change behavior , then that begins with frog-marching the employers off to the federal pokey . The federal government does not have a very good record on that , and winning convictions in such cases is difficult . But it is the employers who provide the main lure for illegal immigration in the first place . And , unlike the millions of illegal immigrants , we know where they live .\\nRepublicans should be the responsible party on immigration . The Democrats are too much in thrall to identity politics to do be that . And Republicans should not fear a shutdown .\\nWhat they should fear is getting too little in exchange .

When President Donald Trump surprised Senator Schumer and Representative Nancy Pelosi — the other half of the Democrats’ noisome slapstick-comedy duo — by broadcasting their acrimonious Oval Office meeting, the anguine gentleman from New York was caught off-guard.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nSenator Schumer and Representative Pelosi invoked the word “shutdown” as though it were a magical incantation. President Trump said that he’d be “proud” to shut down the government if he doesn’t get funding for a border wall. As Trump bellowed and berated the Democrats, “Schumer sat staring forward and not meeting the president’s eyes,” as CNBC put it. The promise of that kind of spectacle is about one half of why Donald Trump was elected.\\n\\nIllegal immigration is the other half.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThose of us who take a more miserly view of the enumerated powers of the federal government believe that it does not have very many legitimate jobs to do. Instead of doing a few things well, it does many, many, many things — badly. But if the federal apparatus serves any purpose at all, providing for national security — beginning with securing the borders — is it.\\n\\nWashington should do its damned job. Which it will, once it has exhausted every other option. Republicans have the chance to take some of those options away.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nDisorder is always undesirable in government. And this year’s installment of shutdown theater finds many different currents of chaos adjoined: an increasingly dysfunctional constitutional order in which the legislative branch has effectively abdicated and ceded much of its power to the executive; a border that in practice is defended by very little more than strong language; a broken congressional budgeting process in which the regular order of appropriations have been supplanted by a series of “continuing resolutions,” stopgap measures that have now been passed more than 100 times in this still-young century.\\n\\nThat last one is worth thinking on some. From the Congressional Research Service:\\n\\nBetween FY1977 and FY2016 (excluding the four fiscal years in which all appropriations were enacted on time), over half of the regular appropriations bills for a fiscal year were enacted on time in only one instance (FY1978). In all other fiscal years, fewer than six regular appropriations acts were enacted on or before October 1. In addition, in 14 out of the 40 years during this period, none of these regular appropriations bills were enacted prior to the start of the fiscal year. Nine of these fiscal years have occurred in the interval since FY2001.\\n\\nThe abandonment of what budget geeks refer to as “regular order” — the consideration, revision, and passage of a dozen or so separate appropriations bills moving through the ordinary congressional committee process — keeps Washington effectively in a state of constant fiscal emergency. That leads to a great deal of drama and much gnashing of teeth, but the stakes are almost trivial: Federal “shutdowns” are really nothing of the sort, with most of the essential functions of the government continuing uninterrupted. We don’t dock the aircraft carriers or put the nuclear arsenal in standby mode. The Obama administration made a great show of closing national parks, going so far as to surround the National Mall with barricades.\\n\\nRepublicans used to fear being blamed for these things, a part of the more general Republican tendency to fear being blamed for things. But they have discovered that the political price for these acts of theater is pretty low. They are slow learners, but they learn — or at least they can, where there is a question of self-preservation. Mainly, shutdowns inconvenience the federal workers who get furloughed, which upsets their household finances. One feels for them. What’s rarely said aloud but surely appreciated by Republicans is that practically all of them are Democrats, as are the great majority of non-military government employees. If you have to hurt somebody, very few Republican voters are going to weep for the bureaucracy.\\n\\nRepublicans ought to be the party of order. (Ought; they are not.) But border security is an issue worth taking a stand on, even at the cost of a little ceremonial disorder. The politics are broadly on the side of those who wish to see the borders more adequately secured, and the issue will put Democrats in the position of defending illegal immigration — legal immigrants would not be much inconvenienced by a wall.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe problem is that the Republicans have the right politics but the wrong policy. (Often, the opposite is the case.) Building a wall would bring some benefits and would present the Trump administration with an important symbolic victory, but it is at best an incomplete policy, and in some ways a bad one. For much of the U.S.-Mexico border, a wall is neither practical nor desirable, something that would be clear to the denizens of Washington if they spent much time on the parts of the border that are not within micturition distance of a Starbucks in San Diego.\\n\\nPart of the problem with a wall is that it does things that we don’t want to do, such as necessitating the appropriation of private property along the border, interrupting access to water, etc. Those problems are mostly solvable. The bigger problem with a wall is that it does not do what we want it to do: cut off the flow of illegal immigrants. Most new illegal immigrants do not enter the United States by wading across the Rio Grande. They come legally on visas and fail to leave when required. You can build the wall ten feet higher or twenty feet higher, but unless you are going to build it high enough to cut off international air traffic, it will not solve the problem.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nIf the Republicans are going to shut down the government over border security, they should do it on behalf of a better border-security agenda. The most important reform would be putting an electronic wall between would-be illegal workers and their employers through a robust, mandatory program of employment-eligibility verification. And then there’s the mundane, tedious work of everyday law enforcement: Raiding a few construction sites will net a few illegal drywall installers, but if you really want to change behavior, then that begins with frog-marching the employers off to the federal pokey. The federal government does not have a very good record on that, and winning convictions in such cases is difficult. But it is the employers who provide the main lure for illegal immigration in the first place. And, unlike the millions of illegal immigrants, we know where they live.\\n\\nRepublicans should be the responsible party on immigration. The Democrats are too much in thrall to identity politics to do be that. And Republicans should not fear a shutdown.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nWhat they should fear is getting too little in exchange.   www.nationalreview.com     right  zl7kc7EmAyIdUMIo\n",

                                                         “ The 360 ” shows you diverse perspectives on the day ’ s top stories and debates .\\nWhen the coronavirus first began spreading from China to the rest of the world , public health experts issued dire warnings about the toll the virus would take on poor countries . The United Nations predicted in early April that as many as 3.3 million people in Africa may die from COVID-19 . Philanthropist Melinda Gates warned of “ bodies out on the street ” on the continent . Similarly dire forecasts were made about developing nations in Latin America , Asia and elsewhere .\\nIn March and April , however , the worst impacts of the pandemic were concentrated in wealthy countries in North America and Europe , while the bulk of the developing world reported remarkably low numbers of infections . At the end of April , low-income countries accounted for just 14 percent of global COVID-19 deaths despite being home to 84 percent of the world ’ s population .\\nThat trend has shifted significantly over the past two months . Rich countries , with the obvious exception of the United States , have gradually gotten their outbreaks under control . At the same time , the situation has gotten much worse in developing countries . Latin America is now the global epicenter of the pandemic , driven by major outbreaks in Brazil , Chile , Peru and Mexico . The number of new daily cases in India has skyrocketed as lockdown measures there are being lifted .\\nSome experts are concerned that developing nations are seeing the beginnings of the worst-case scenarios that were predicted in the early stages of the pandemic . Many of these countries are home to incredibly densely populated cities with limited access to sanitation and poor public health infrastructure — conditions that could lead to a devastating outbreak . It ’ s also possible that limited testing has underrepresented the true size of the outbreak until recently .\\nWhile reduced travel from Western countries may have delayed the spread of the virus , it appears now to have taken hold in several vulnerable countries , epidemiologists say . Poorer nations also are particularly at risk of severe economic consequences of the pandemic , which may compel their governments to relax lockdown measures in order to avoid food crises within their borders .\\nWhile the situation in some places appears dire , there are reasons for optimism , some experts argue . For all the challenges they face , many developing nations have done an excellent job containing the spread of the virus . Years spent combating diseases like HIV , malaria and Ebola mean that the epidemic response in some countries is much more sophisticated than people in the West might expect . Conditions on the ground may also help limit the severity of the outbreak in some places . Insufficient roads and lack of public transport can make it difficult for the virus to travel from one community to another . Developing nations also tend to have much younger populations than wealthy countries — the median age in Africa is 20 years old — which could mean fewer deaths even if there is a high number of cases .\\nThe next several weeks will be critical in deciding how bad the pandemic gets in the developing world . Countries that are already being hit hard , like Brazil and India , could see their outbreaks grow to rival the U.S. for worst in the world if trends continue . Nations that have so far contained the virus , like Vietnam and Uruguay , may not experience significant outbreaks at all .\\nUnless something changes , a handful of developing nations will be devastated by the virus\\n“ If the curves in these countries do not start flattening , the damage will be worse than anything we ’ ve seen in the West . The population density and sanitary conditions make the rapid spread of the disease seem inevitable. ” — Fareed Zakaria , CNN\\nMany poor countries have taken smart steps to effectively contain the virus\\n“ Western media sources tend to emphasize developing countries ’ challenges rather than their achievements . … But the available evidence suggests that developing countries have tackled COVID-19 not through luck or chance , but rather through the diligent efforts of their politicians and their populations. ” — Michael Hobbes , HuffPost

began spreading from China to the rest of the world, public health experts issued dire warnings about the toll the virus would take on poor countries. The United Nations predicted in early April that as many as 3.3 million people in Africa may die from COVID-19. Philanthropist Melinda Gates warned of “bodies out on the street” on the continent. Similarly dire forecasts were made about developing nations in Latin America, Asia and elsewhere.\\n\\nIn March and April, however, the worst impacts of the pandemic were concentrated in wealthy countries in North America and Europe, while the bulk of the developing world reported remarkably low numbers of infections. At the end of April, low-income countries accounted for just 14 percent of global COVID-19 deaths despite being home to 84 percent of the world’s population.\\n\\nThat trend has shifted significantly over the past two months. Rich countries, with the obvious exception of the United States, have gradually gotten their outbreaks under control. At the same time, the situation has gotten much worse in developing countries. Latin America is now the global epicenter of the pandemic, driven by major outbreaks in Brazil, Chile, Peru and Mexico. The number of new daily cases in India has skyrocketed as lockdown measures there are being lifted.\\n\\nWhy there’s debate\\n\\nSome experts are concerned that developing nations are seeing the beginnings of the worst-case scenarios that were predicted in the early stages of the pandemic. Many of these countries are home to incredibly densely populated cities with limited access to sanitation and poor public health infrastructure — conditions that could lead to a devastating outbreak. It’s also possible that limited testing has underrepresented the true size of the outbreak until recently.\\n\\nWhile reduced travel from Western countries may have delayed the spread of the virus, it appears now to have taken hold in several vulnerable countries, epidemiologists say. Poorer nations also are particularly at risk of severe economic consequences of the pandemic, which may compel their governments to relax lockdown measures in order to avoid food crises within their borders.\\n\\nWhile the situation in some places appears dire, there are reasons for optimism, some experts argue. For all the challenges they face, many developing nations have done an excellent job containing the spread of the virus. Years spent combating diseases like HIV, malaria and Ebola mean that the epidemic response in some countries is much more sophisticated than people in the West might expect. Conditions on the ground may also help limit the severity of the outbreak in some places. Insufficient roads and lack of public transport can make it difficult for the virus to travel from one community to another. Developing nations also tend to have much younger populations than wealthy countries — the median age in Africa is 20 years old — which could mean fewer deaths even if there is a high number of cases.\\n\\nWhat’s next\\n\\nThe next several weeks will be critical in deciding how bad the pandemic gets in the developing world. Countries that are already being hit hard, like Brazil and India, could see their outbreaks grow to rival the U.S. for worst in the world if trends continue. Nations that have so far contained the virus, like Vietnam and Uruguay, may not experience significant outbreaks at all.\\n\\nPerspectives\\n\\nUnless something changes, a handful of developing nations will be devastated by the virus\\n\\n“If the curves in these countries do not start flattening, the damage will be worse than anything we’ve seen in the West. The population density and sanitary conditions make the rapid spread of the disease seem inevitable.” — Fareed Zakaria, CNN\\n\\nMany poor countries have taken smart steps to effectively contain the virus\\n\\n“Western media sources tend to emphasize developing countries’ challenges rather than their achievements. … But the available evidence suggests that developing countries have tackled COVID-19 not through luck or chance, but rather through the diligent efforts of their politicians and their populations.” — Michael Hobbes, HuffPost       www.news.yahoo.com    center  xpbjYTJYPdlw6HmJ\n",

Jackson, Nick Gass  LOS ANGELES — Actress Rosario Dawson took the stage at a Bernie Sanders rally here in late June , a “ Talk Bernie to Me ” tote bag at her side , as hundreds of boisterous supporters cheered and waved signs . Dawson smiled and triumphantly lifted a sign of her own .\\n`` All the way ! '' Dawson shouted , shorthand for taking the pro-Sanders fight all the way to the Democratic convention .\\nThe Democratic primary ended more than three weeks ago . Sanders himself , who wasn ’ t present at the rally , has toned down his criticism of Hillary Clinton , shifting his focus to defeating Donald Trump and admitting that his “ political revolution ” will almost certainly end without him in the White House .\\nBut in California , the forever Sanders movement is still Berning full force .\\n“ Here in California , people are very much more revved up and still revved up , ” said Steve Dunwoody , a Los Angeles-area Sanders volunteer who was recently elected as a delegate to the Democratic National Convention .\\nActivists here point to a number of factors that are fanning the embers . There ’ s a general distrust of Clinton and of the system that has built up over the long primary campaign . But there are also more local grievances : anger at the slow pace of vote counting after Election Day , as well as a belief that Sanders ’ loss in the primary was driven in part by the media declaring Clinton the presumptive nominee the night before voters went to the polls .\\nIt ’ s a fire that feeds itself . As elsewhere , Sanders supporters in California are a tight-knit group who stay in touch , back each other up on social media and push their revolution forward . To a person , they don ’ t want to let go of the feeling campaign 2016 has inspired in them .\\nSome activists even insist that Sanders may yet win California , when all the votes are counted . While Clinton won California on election night , her margin has shrunk a bit , from about 12 percentage points to 8 percentage points . And , three weeks later , counting is not quite wrapped up . There were about 350,000 potential ballots still to be counted as of June 30 , according to the California secretary of state ’ s website . Officials have attributed the glacial pace to thousands of vote-by-mail and provisional ballots still being counted at a local level .\\nThe lingering resentments don ’ t mean a rift in the Democratic Party will put California up for grabs in November . Democrats far outnumber Republicans here , a state so blue that its upcoming Senate race will be decided by a runoff between two Democratic candidates .\\nInstead , the fear for Clinton is that the lingering far-left resentment may be shared by like-minded Sanders supporters in swing states , where she will be more dependent on party unity to defeat Trump .\\nWhile Clinton and national Democrats evince confidence that Sanders supporters will eventually back her , national polling shows why the continued angst in California is problematic : A recent Bloomberg poll showed that only a bit more than half — 55 percent — of Sanders supporters said they were planning to back Clinton . Some 22 percent said they would back Trump . Another recent NBC/Wall Street Journal poll found better support for Clinton among Sanders supporters , with 78 percent of Sanders voters backing Clinton , numbers that had improved from a previous poll .\\nBut here , the pragmatic case for party unity has to compete with ubiquitous displays of pro-Sanders passion . In rallies and protests that have continued after the June 7 primary , and in social media posts and stubborn displays of bumper stickers and yard signs , the examples of continuing tension are all over the state . In cities such as Los Angeles and San Francisco , murals of Sanders ’ image still beam down from walls .\\nFor many activists , talk of surrendering the revolution to unite against a common enemy is infuriating .\\nMichael Seaman , who lives in an unincorporated area outside of the state capital , Sacramento , said he still “ prays that Bernie ends up the nominee at the convention. ” He grows angry every time he gets an email from the Democratic National Committee , he says , because he views them as pestering him to give up . His wife , he says , plans to leave the Democratic Party because of what they see as an unfair process .\\n“ I believe that both the alleged nominees are not good choices . And I 've spent my whole life voting for the lesser of two evils , and I 'm sick and tired of it , ” he said .\\nHe would like to see the Democratic platform represent some of the progressive ideas Sanders championed . Even then , he said , he ’ s learned enough about Hillary Clinton that he ’ s fairly sure he can ’ t support her .\\n“ The party is putting a lot at risk if it disrespects some of the people involved , people I have met who are previously uninvolved voters and independents , ” Seaman said . “ They could easily bring people into their tent . Instead they ’ re marginalizing their party . ''\\nDunwoody , who worked as a campaign staffer for Barack Obama in the 2008 primary and on into the general election , said tensions among many activists in California were higher than at any point he could remember during the similar end-of-the-primary period between Obama and Clinton . He said that he personally was more focused on shaping the party platform and noted that Sanders himself has acknowledged he won ’ t be the Democratic nominee .\\nBernie Sanders speaks at a rally on Sunday , May 22 in Vista , Calif. | AP Photo\\n“ What most Sanders supporters are asking for here isn ’ t unreasonable , ” he said , citing a more progressive platform on income inequality , opposition to fracking and reforms of the election system that reduce the role of money in politics .\\nWith the primary contests over , Sanders himself has tapered his campaign . He hasn ’ t held any big rallies of late . He even revealed , somewhat stiltedly , that he would vote for Hillary Clinton , though he hasn ’ t endorsed her . Behind the scenes , trusted aides have talked with Clinton ’ s operation about the best steps going forward . In general , it ’ s a slow , somewhat awkward , march to armistice .\\nThe California Democratic Party has taken its own measures to cool the debate : Its executive board passed a resolution the same day it seated its delegation for the Democratic convention that addressed one of Sanders supporters ’ top goals , reforming the Democratic primary process .\\nThe resolution supported eliminating caucuses , limiting the number of unpledged delegates and binding delegates to the popular vote . The proposal was jointly written by an unpledged delegate supporting Clinton , Christine Pelosi — daughter of House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi — and a pledged Sanders delegate , Daraka Larimore-Hall . Reforming the nominating process has been one of the priorities of Sanders supporters .\\nState party chairman John Burton has also implored state party delegates to unite and focus on Trump . “ We ’ ve got a common enemy for almost anybody decent , ” Burton told state delegates recently . “ Donald Trump . ”\\nNaureen Jahangir , a Sanders supporter from Hemet , California , is among those who say they have no intention of backing Clinton . The Sanders campaign was the first time she had been politically involved , and she doesn ’ t think Clinton can address the issues that Sanders raised during the primary .\\nChoosing between Clinton and Sanders is a “ false choice , because it 's a choice between Clinton , Trump , Gary Johnson , and Dr. Jill Stein , at the very least , ” she said .\\n“ I will vote for the candidate that best represents my viewpoint as a progressive Democrat , and that will be Jill Stein if Bernie is not the candidate . ”\\nLike a lot of California supporters , Jahangir said she was angered by the the media declaring Clinton had enough delegates to be the nominee before the California vote . Doing so ” appeared to be an attempt at poisoning the California election. ” She thinks Sanders winning California could have changed the election in his favor .\\nSuch sentiments hung in the air at the “ Still Sanders ” rally in Hollywood , which was parked just outside CNN ’ s building there . CNN , like The Associated Press , which was the first organization to do so , declared Clinton had enough delegates to become the presumptive nominee the night before the California primary by using a tabulation of pledged delegates and superdelegates who had publicly pledged their support to Clinton .\\nOn the same day as the rally , Sanders was on CNN talking about what he does next .\\nHe said there had been some “ good gains ” in the pursuit of a more progressive platform , but he pressed Clinton to do more if she wanted to win over his supporters .\\n“ If she does the right thing , I am absolutely confident that the vast majority of my voters will vote for her , '' Sanders said .

Democrats far outnumber Republicans here, a state so blue that its upcoming Senate race will be decided by a runoff between two Democratic candidates.\\n\\nInstead, the fear for Clinton is that the lingering far-left resentment may be shared by like-minded Sanders supporters in swing states, where she will be more dependent on party unity to defeat Trump.\\n\\nWhile Clinton and national Democrats evince confidence that Sanders supporters will eventually back her, national polling shows why the continued angst in California is problematic: A recent Bloomberg poll showed that only a bit more than half — 55 percent — of Sanders supporters said they were planning to back Clinton. Some 22 percent said they would back Trump. Another recent NBC/Wall Street Journal poll found better support for Clinton among Sanders supporters, with 78 percent of Sanders voters backing Clinton, numbers that had improved from a previous poll.\\n\\nBut here, the pragmatic case for party unity has to compete with ubiquitous displays of pro-Sanders passion. In rallies and protests that have continued after the June 7 primary, and in social media posts and stubborn displays of bumper stickers and yard signs, the examples of continuing tension are all over the state. In cities such as Los Angeles and San Francisco, murals of Sanders’ image still beam down from walls.\\n\\nFor many activists, talk of surrendering the revolution to unite against a common enemy is infuriating.\\n\\nMichael Seaman, who lives in an unincorporated area outside of the state capital, Sacramento, said he still “prays that Bernie ends up the nominee at the convention.” He grows angry every time he gets an email from the Democratic National Committee, he says, because he views them as pestering him to give up. His wife, he says, plans to leave the Democratic Party because of what they see as an unfair process.\\n\\n“I believe that both the alleged nominees are not good choices. And I've spent my whole life voting for the lesser of two evils, and I'm sick and tired of it,” he said.\\n\\nHe would like to see the Democratic platform represent some of the progressive ideas Sanders championed. Even then, he said, he’s learned enough about Hillary Clinton that he’s fairly sure he can’t support her.\\n\\n“The party is putting a lot at risk if it disrespects some of the people involved, people I have met who are previously uninvolved voters and independents,” Seaman said. “They could easily bring people into their tent. Instead they’re marginalizing their party.\"\\n\\nDunwoody, who worked as a campaign staffer for Barack Obama in the 2008 primary and on into the general election, said tensions among many activists in California were higher than at any point he could remember during the similar end-of-the-primary period between Obama and Clinton. He said that he personally was more focused on shaping the party platform and noted that Sanders himself has acknowledged he won’t be the Democratic nominee.\\n\\nBernie Sanders speaks at a rally on Sunday, May 22 in Vista, Calif. | AP Photo\\n\\n“What most Sanders supporters are asking for here isn’t unreasonable,” he said, citing a more progressive platform on income inequality, opposition to fracking and reforms of the election system that reduce the role of money in politics.\\n\\nWith the primary contests over, Sanders himself has tapered his campaign. He hasn’t held any big rallies of late. He even revealed, somewhat stiltedly, that he would vote for Hillary Clinton, though he hasn’t endorsed her. Behind the scenes, trusted aides have talked with Clinton’s operation about the best steps going forward. In general, it’s a slow, somewhat awkward, march to armistice.\\n\\nThe California Democratic Party has taken its own measures to cool the debate: Its executive board passed a resolution the same day it seated its delegation for the Democratic convention that addressed one of Sanders supporters’ top goals, reforming the Democratic primary process.\\n\\nThe resolution supported eliminating caucuses, limiting the number of unpledged delegates and binding delegates to the popular vote. The proposal was jointly written by an unpledged delegate supporting Clinton, Christine Pelosi — daughter of House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi — and a pledged Sanders delegate, Daraka Larimore-Hall. Reforming the nominating process has been one of the priorities of Sanders supporters.\\n\\nState party chairman John Burton has also implored state party delegates to unite and focus on Trump. “We’ve got a common enemy for almost anybody decent,” Burton told state delegates recently. “Donald Trump.”\\n\\nNaureen Jahangir, a Sanders supporter from Hemet, California, is among those who say they have no intention of backing Clinton. The Sanders campaign was the first time she had been politically involved, and she doesn’t think Clinton can address the issues that Sanders raised during the primary.\\n\\nChoosing between Clinton and Sanders is a “false choice, because it's a choice between Clinton, Trump, Gary Johnson, and Dr. Jill Stein, at the very least,” she said.\\n\\n“I will vote for the candidate that best represents my viewpoint as a progressive Democrat, and that will be Jill Stein if Bernie is not the candidate.”\\n\\nLike a lot of California supporters, Jahangir said she was angered by the the media declaring Clinton had enough delegates to be the nominee before the California vote. Doing so ”appeared to be an attempt at poisoning the California election.” She thinks Sanders winning California could have changed the election in his favor.\\n\\nSuch sentiments hung in the air at the “Still Sanders” rally in Hollywood, which was parked just outside CNN’s building there. CNN, like The Associated Press, which was the first organization to do so, declared Clinton had enough delegates to become the presumptive nominee the night before the California primary by using a tabulation of pledged delegates and superdelegates who had publicly pledged their support to Clinton.\\n\\nOn the same day as the rally, Sanders was on CNN talking about what he does next.\\n\\nHe said there had been some “good gains” in the pursuit of a more progressive platform, but he pressed Clinton to do more if she wanted to win over his supporters.\\n\\n“If she does the right thing, I am absolutely confident that the vast majority of my voters will vote for her,\" Sanders said.         www.politico.com      left  k4SGI3GXarnz5dJl\n",

He has been my attorney . ''\\nWhen The Washington Post 's Josh Dawsey texted Giuliani asking him about Trump 's comments and if he was still representing the president , Giuliani replied , `` Yes . ''\\nGiuliani and Trump are at the center of a public firestorm surrounding their efforts to get the Ukrainian government to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son , Hunter , ahead of the 2020 election .\\nOn Wednesday , two of Giuliani 's foreign associates were arrested and charged by the FBI with campaign-finance violations .\\nThe Soviet-born men , Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman , are suspected of trying to funnel foreign money into a pro-Trump super PAC and other entities to gain leverage in US political circles .

On Friday , ABC News reported that federal prosecutors at the SDNY — the office Giuliani used to run — are scrutinizing the former New York mayor 's relationship with the two men .\\nTrump and Giuliani 's efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate the Bidens were at the center of an explosive whistleblower complaint that a US intelligence official filed against Trump in August .\\nAmong other things , the complainant alleged that the president abused his power to `` solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 US election '' during a July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky .\\nGiuliani was mentioned 31 times in the complaint and is described as a `` central figure '' in Trump 's effort . The complaint said Attorney General William Barr `` appears to be involved as well . ''\\nGiuliani has said that he got involved in Trump 's efforts only after State Department officials asked him to do so . Text messages between several top US diplomats and Giuliani that were released last week confirmed Giuliani 's claim .\\nThe whistleblower 's complaint is at the heart of a brewing congressional impeachment inquiry looking at whether Trump used his public office for private gain . House Democrats sent out a flurry of subpoenas and document requests , but the White House said earlier this week that it would not cooperate with what it views as a `` partisan and unconstitutional

He has been my attorney.\"\\n\\nWhen The Washington Post's Josh Dawsey texted Giuliani asking him about Trump's comments and if he was still representing the president, Giuliani replied, \"Yes.\"\\n\\nGiuliani and Trump are at the center of a public firestorm surrounding their efforts to get the Ukrainian government to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, ahead of the 2020 election.\\n\\nOn Wednesday, two of Giuliani's foreign associates were arrested and charged by the FBI with campaign-finance violations.\\n\\nThe Soviet-born men, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, are suspected of trying to funnel foreign money into a pro-Trump super PAC and other entities to gain leverage in US political circles. Prosecutors also allege Parnas and Fruman tried to influence US-Ukraine relations.\\n\\nTwo of their associates, David Correira and Andrey Kukushkin, were also indicted along with Parnas and Fruman on Thursday.\\n\\nRead more: 2 of Rudy Giuliani's associates who prosecutors say helped him dig up dirt on Joe Biden have been charged with campaign finance violations\\n\\nParnas and Fruman were directly involved in Giuliani's efforts to dig up dirt on the Bidens, according to reports, and Giuliani has been working with them since at least March. On Friday, ABC News reported that federal prosecutors at the SDNY — the office Giuliani used to run — are scrutinizing the former New York mayor's relationship with the two men.\\n\\nTrump and Giuliani's efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate the Bidens were at the center of an explosive whistleblower complaint that a US intelligence official filed against Trump in August.\\n\\nAmong other things, the complainant alleged that the president abused his power to \"solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 US election\" during a July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\\n\\nGiuliani was mentioned 31 times in the complaint and is described as a \"central figure\" in Trump's effort. The complaint said Attorney General William Barr \"appears to be involved as well.\"\\n\\nGiuliani has said that he got involved in Trump's efforts only after State Department officials asked him to do so. Text messages between several top US diplomats and Giuliani that were released last week confirmed Giuliani's claim.\\n\\nThe whistleblower's complaint is at the heart of a brewing congressional impeachment inquiry looking at whether Trump used his public office for private gain. House Democrats sent out a flurry of subpoenas and document requests, but the White House said earlier this week that it would not cooperate with what it views as a \"partisan and unconstitutional\" process.  www.businessinsider.com    center  0jIpietfnrPRGHKQ\n",

ET following a day of tradition marking the power shift in the nation 's capital .\\nIn a time-honored ceremony on the flag-draped West Front of the Capitol earlier in the afternoon , Trump placed his left hand on a family Bible and another that belonged to Abraham Lincoln and promised to preserve , protect and defend the Constitution . As light rain began to fall on a crowd stretching toward the Washington Monument , Trump took the oath of office from Chief Justice John Roberts with the new first lady , Melania , by his side .\\nTrump 's inaugural address centered on the themes that animated his stunning outsider campaign , which shattered political conventions and gave voice to heartland voters who felt badly let down by professional politicians .\\nThough he paid tribute to outgoing President Barack Obama , the President sketched a vision of America that came across as a repudiation of the last administration . He promised to restore the nation 's strength and purpose and to rebuild it from within , vowing to `` bring back '' American jobs , borders , wealth and dreams .\\n`` We assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city , and in every foreign capital and in every hall of power , '' Trump said . `` From this day forward , a new vision will govern our land , from this day forward , it 's going to be only 'America first ! America first ! ' ''\\nTrump talked of a nation of mothers and children trapped in poverty in the inner cities and `` rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones , '' and warned crime and gangs had robbed the nation of much of its potential .\\n`` This American carnage stops right here and stops right now , '' Trump said , with Obama looking on .\\n`` A new national pride will stir our souls , lift our sights and heal our divisions , '' Trump said , emphasizing that whether people are black or white they still bleed the same red blood of patriots .\\nJUST WATCHED Moments from Pres .

He later recognized her during a congressional lunch , when she received a standing ovation .\\n`` I was very honored , very , very honored when I heard that President Bill Clinton and Secretary Hillary Clinton was coming today , I think it is appropriate to say it , '' Trump said . `` Honestly , there is nothing more I can say because I have a lot of respect for those two people . ''\\nThe swearing-in was one of many traditions that began Friday morning . Trump and his family attended a private worship service at St. John 's Episcopal Church , known as the church of presidents . The Obamas greeted Trump and the new first lady at the North Portico of the White House before hosting them for tea .\\nEarlier in the morning , Obama wrote a letter to Trump and left it on the Resolute desk in the Oval Office , as outgoing presidents typically do for their successors .

As light rain began to fall on a crowd stretching toward the Washington Monument, Trump took the oath of office from Chief Justice John Roberts with the new first lady, Melania, by his side.\\n\\nTrump's inaugural address centered on the themes that animated his stunning outsider campaign, which shattered political conventions and gave voice to heartland voters who felt badly let down by professional politicians.\\n\\nThough he paid tribute to outgoing President Barack Obama, the President sketched a vision of America that came across as a repudiation of the last administration. He promised to restore the nation's strength and purpose and to rebuild it from within, vowing to \"bring back\" American jobs, borders, wealth and dreams.\\n\\n\"We assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city, and in every foreign capital and in every hall of power,\" Trump said. \"From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land, from this day forward, it's going to be only 'America first! America first!'\"\\n\\nTrump: 'You will never be ignored again'\\n\\nTrump talked of a nation of mothers and children trapped in poverty in the inner cities and \"rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones,\" and warned crime and gangs had robbed the nation of much of its potential.\\n\\n\"This American carnage stops right here and stops right now,\" Trump said, with Obama looking on.\\n\\n\"A new national pride will stir our souls, lift our sights and heal our divisions,\" Trump said, emphasizing that whether people are black or white they still bleed the same red blood of patriots.\\n\\nJUST WATCHED Moments from Pres.

Hillary Clinton, whom Trump defeated in the November election, was in the audience in a show of support for national unity and the peaceful transfer of presidential authority.\\n\\nJUST WATCHED Hillary Clinton arrives at Trump inauguration Replay More Videos ...

He later recognized her during a congressional lunch, when she received a standing ovation.\\n\\n\"I was very honored, very, very honored when I heard that President Bill Clinton and Secretary Hillary Clinton was coming today, I think it is appropriate to say it,\" Trump said. \"Honestly, there is nothing more I can say because I have a lot of respect for those two people.\"\\n\\nMany traditions\\n\\nThe swearing-in was one of many traditions that began Friday morning. Trump and his family attended a private worship service at St. John's Episcopal Church, known as the church of presidents. The Obamas greeted Trump and the new first lady at the North Portico of the White House before hosting them for tea.\\n\\nEarlier in the morning, Obama wrote a letter to Trump and left it on the Resolute desk in the Oval Office, as outgoing presidents typically do for their successors. As Obama left the Oval Office for the final time, he was asked whether he had any words for the American people. \"Thank you,\" Obama responded.\\n\\nJUST WATCHED President Obama leaves Oval Office Replay More Videos ...

economic package , the largest in US history\\nUS coronavirus stimulus checks : are you eligible and how much will you get ?\\nThe US has agreed on a $ 2tn stimulus package , the largest economic stimulus in US history , in response to the economic impacts of Covid-19 . While corporations will be the biggest recipients of the bailout , some of that money will be paid directly to Americans hit by the pandemic .\\nMost taxpayers will get a check in the mail , while those directly affected by the economic effects of Covid-19 are slated to receive robust government support .\\nHere ’ s what we know so far about how the new stimulus package will directly affect Americans in the coming weeks :\\nCongress will spend about $ 250bn for checks up to $ 1,200 per person that will go directly to taxpayers .\\nTo be eligible for the full amount , a person ’ s most recently filed tax return must show that they made $ 75,000 or under . For couples , who can receive a maximum of $ 2,400 , the cutoff is $ 150,000 .\\nIf a person makes more than $ 75,000 , the amount given goes down incrementally by $ 5 for every $ 100 increase in salary . So a person who makes $ 85,000 would get $ 700 while a person who makes $ 95,000 would get $ 200 .\\nIf a person makes above $ 99,000 , or a couple makes above $ 198,000 , no check will be given .\\nThere are some requirements and exceptions . Those getting a check must be living and working in the US and have a valid social security number . If a person is listed as a dependent on their parents ’ tax return – the case for many college students – they are excluded .\\nThe Tax Foundation , a DC-based thinktank , estimates that 93.6 % of Americans will be eligible for a check coming from the stimulus package .\\nTaxpayers will be given $ 500 per child 16 or under listed as a dependent on their latest tax return .\\nThat is still unclear . Experts say that Americans will probably not get the money until May , given how long it takes the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) to send out checks . The treasury secretary , Steven Mnuchin , said those whose bank account information is already with the IRS from previous tax returns can expect a payment “ within three weeks ” .\\nFor those who still need to give the IRS their bank account information , a web-based portal will be opening soon to allow people to provide the IRS with their information . The IRS says this is to make sure people get their checks immediately , instead of sending them through the mail .\\nThis is not the first time the government has sent checks to Americans . The federal government gave up to $ 300 in 2001 and $ 600 in 2008 to taxpayers who met a certain income bracket to similarly stimulate the economy .\\nWhat if a person did not file their 2018 or 2019 return ?\\nThe IRS recommends people file their 2018 or 2019 tax return as soon as possible to get the payment . A check will be sent to any qualified person so long as they file their return within 2020 .\\nA person may still be eligible even if they do not file the taxes . The IRS says people who typically do not file taxes – low-income taxpayers and some veterans – will need to file a “ simple tax return ” in order to get the payment . Social security beneficiaries will not need to fill out the tax return , even if they do not file their taxes , to get the payment .\\nYes , specifically the bill will increase unemployment insurance by $ 600 for 13 weeks – about four months – for every person , added to the existing unemployment compensation a person gets from their state ’ s program .\\nThe length and amount of compensation varies from state to state . A majority of states providing a maximum of 26 weeks of compensation , while average weekly compensation ranges from 20 % of a person ’ s wage to just over 50 % .\\nWhile unemployment insurance typically does not cover people who are self-employed – freelancers , contractors and gig workers – the bill comes with a “ pandemic unemployment assistance ” measure that will extend insurance to those workers .\\nPlay Video 2:25 'The universe is collapsing ' : Bernie Sanders mocks Republicans over coronavirus aid – video\\nNot in this bill . Earlier last week , Donald Trump signed the Families First Coronavirus Response Act , a bill worth about $ 100bn meant to expand paid sick leave and emergency paid leave , but it came with major loopholes . Companies with over 500 employees were not mentioned in the bill , while companies with under 50 employees can apply for exemptions .\\nThe bill mandates 10 days of fully paid sick leave for employees of companies with 500 employees or less . Parents of those companies affected by their children ’ s school closing and those leaving for medical reasons can get 12 weeks of pay at 67 % of their salary .\\nWill there be anything to offset healthcare costs related to Covid-19 ?\\nAgain , not in this bill . The Families First Coronavirus Response Act included a measure that mandated all Covid-19 testing is free , but treatment for any symptoms ( there is currently no cure for the illness ) still comes at a cost .\\nA few states have reopened enrollment for their health insurance programs to allow those concerned about costs to enroll , and three major health insurance companies said they will be waiving any high costs for treatment , but there are still stories of people getting bills for as much as $ 34,000 to cover treatment of the virus ’ s symptoms .

                    Most taxpayers will get a check from the $2tn economic package, the largest in US history\\n\\nUS coronavirus stimulus checks: are you eligible and how much will you get?\\n\\nThe US has agreed on a $2tn stimulus package, the largest economic stimulus in US history, in response to the economic impacts of Covid-19. While corporations will be the biggest recipients of the bailout, some of that money will be paid directly to Americans hit by the pandemic.\\n\\nMost taxpayers will get a check in the mail, while those directly affected by the economic effects of Covid-19 are slated to receive robust government support.\\n\\nHere’s what we know so far about how the new stimulus package will directly affect Americans in the coming weeks:\\n\\nWho’s eligible for a check from the government?\\n\\nCongress will spend about $250bn for checks up to $1,200 per person that will go directly to taxpayers.\\n\\nTo be eligible for the full amount, a person’s most recently filed tax return must show that they made $75,000 or under. For couples, who can receive a maximum of $2,400, the cutoff is $150,000.\\n\\nIf a person makes more than $75,000, the amount given goes down incrementally by $5 for every $100 increase in salary. So a person who makes $85,000 would get $700 while a person who makes $95,000 would get $200.\\n\\nIf a person makes above $99,000, or a couple makes above $198,000, no check will be given.\\n\\nThere are some requirements and exceptions. Those getting a check must be living and working in the US and have a valid social security number. If a person is listed as a dependent on their parents’ tax return – the case for many college students – they are excluded.\\n\\nThe Tax Foundation, a DC-based thinktank, estimates that 93.6% of Americans will be eligible for a check coming from the stimulus package.\\n\\nWhat about parents?\\n\\nTaxpayers will be given $500 per child 16 or under listed as a dependent on their latest tax return.\\n\\nWhen will I get this money?\\n\\nThat is still unclear. Experts say that Americans will probably not get the money until May, given how long it takes the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to send out checks. The treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said those whose bank account information is already with the IRS from previous tax returns can expect a payment “within three weeks”.\\n\\nFor those who still need to give the IRS their bank account information, a web-based portal will be opening soon to allow people to provide the IRS with their information. The IRS says this is to make sure people get their checks immediately, instead of sending them through the mail.\\n\\nThis is not the first time the government has sent checks to Americans. The federal government gave up to $300 in 2001 and $600 in 2008 to taxpayers who met a certain income bracket to similarly stimulate the economy.\\n\\nWhat if a person did not file their 2018 or 2019 return?\\n\\nThe IRS recommends people file their 2018 or 2019 tax return as soon as possible to get the payment. A check will be sent to any qualified person so long as they file their return within 2020.\\n\\nWhat if a person does not file their taxes?\\n\\nA person may still be eligible even if they do not file the taxes. The IRS says people who typically do not file taxes – low-income taxpayers and some veterans – will need to file a “simple tax return” in order to get the payment. Social security beneficiaries will not need to fill out the tax return, even if they do not file their taxes, to get the payment.\\n\\nDoes the package help unemployed workers?\\n\\nYes, specifically the bill will increase unemployment insurance by $600 for 13 weeks – about four months – for every person, added to the existing unemployment compensation a person gets from their state’s program.\\n\\nThe length and amount of compensation varies from state to state. A majority of states providing a maximum of 26 weeks of compensation, while average weekly compensation ranges from 20% of a person’s wage to just over 50%.\\n\\nWhat about freelance and gig workers?\\n\\nWhile unemployment insurance typically does not cover people who are self-employed – freelancers, contractors and gig workers – the bill comes with a “pandemic unemployment assistance” measure that will extend insurance to those workers.\\n\\nPlay Video 2:25 'The universe is collapsing': Bernie Sanders mocks Republicans over coronavirus aid – video\\n\\nHave there been any changes to paid leave?\\n\\nNot in this bill. Earlier last week, Donald Trump signed the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, a bill worth about $100bn meant to expand paid sick leave and emergency paid leave, but it came with major loopholes. Companies with over 500 employees were not mentioned in the bill, while companies with under 50 employees can apply for exemptions.\\n\\nThe bill mandates 10 days of fully paid sick leave for employees of companies with 500 employees or less. Parents of those companies affected by their children’s school closing and those leaving for medical reasons can get 12 weeks of pay at 67% of their salary.\\n\\nWill there be anything to offset healthcare costs related to Covid-19?\\n\\nAgain, not in this bill. The Families First Coronavirus Response Act included a measure that mandated all Covid-19 testing is free, but treatment for any symptoms (there is currently no cure for the illness) still comes at a cost.\\n\\nA few states have reopened enrollment for their health insurance programs to allow those concerned about costs to enroll, and three major health insurance companies said they will be waiving any high costs for treatment, but there are still stories of people getting bills for as much as $34,000 to cover treatment of the virus’s symptoms.      www.theguardian.com      left  IBgtqEHUEcjyMriR\n",

                                                             The backbone of President Obama ’ s health care law is taking shape , with 26 states choosing to let the federal government run the online insurance markets mandated by his signature reforms instead of keeping the job in-house or partnering with the feds .\\nThe Department of Health and Human Services had encouraged states to run their own markets , or “ exchanges , ” that help the uninsured find coverage . Only 17 states and the District took on the task while seven states decided to split the duties , according to a breakdown by the Kaiser Family Foundation .\\nThe exchanges , which are designed to let those without employer-based insurance compare and buy plans with the help of tax credits , are a crucial part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act that passed in 2010 and was largely upheld by the Supreme Court in June . States that wanted to run a partnership exchange with the federal government had to let HHS know by late Friday , ending months or even years of debate among governors and state lawmakers .\\nTheir discussions marked one of two major decisions under “ Obamacare. ” Whether or not to expand Medicaid within their borders is the other , and it remains a source of contention in state capitals across the country .\\nThe Obama administration says it will be ready to run exchanges in more than half of the states , even though a bevy of Republican governors and lawmakers flouted their intentions by saddling them with the task .\\n“ It ’ s not what the drafters of the bill had hoped would happen , ” Timothy S. Jost , a professor at Washington and Lee University School of Law who specializes in health care , said of the outcome on Friday .\\nSEE ALSO : Lost in Spanish translation : ‘ Obamacare ’ ‘ exchanges ’ now ‘ marketplaces ’\\nState leaders who deferred to the federal government cited numerous reasons for their choices ; among them , they wanted to distance themselves from Mr. Obama ’ s first-term achievement , could not obtain enough information to make an informed decision or ran out of time after Mitt Romney lost the presidential election . That loss effectively ended Republicans ’ hopes of repealing the health care law .\\nNew Jersey Gov . Chris Christie sent a letter to HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius on Friday to confirm his previously stated preference for a federally run exchange .\\nWest Virginia , meanwhile , applied for a partnership exchange “ to retain our ability to assist consumers and maintain our traditional authority to regulate health insurance ” in the state , said Jeremiah Samples , an official at the West Virginia Insurance Commission . He said that after months of analysis , officials decided that a state-run exchange would not be worth it because of the state ’ s relatively small market and the hefty information-technology costs associated with the exchange .\\nFrom the start , HHS advised states to run the exchanges so they could tailor them to their residents ’ needs . But the majority said no .\\nMr. Jost said the tilt toward federally run exchanges may help officials in Washington stay on the same page during the early stages of implementation because the marketplaces rely on computer networks that will share data among several federal agencies .\\n“ It ’ s not a particularly bad thing at this point to be doing it this way , ” Mr. Jost said .\\nFederal health officials declined to comment on the states ’ decisions before midnight Friday , making it unlikely they will weigh in on the spectrum of exchanges until this week .\\nThe Obama administration is striking an optimistic tone less than eight months before enrollment begins , despite the burden of implementation .\\n“ We are making great progress , we are on track , and we will be ready for people all across the country to obtain high-quality affordable health care coverage beginning on Oct. 1 , ” Gary Cohen , director of the Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight , told the Senate Finance Committee on Thursday .\\nStates that deferred can change their minds and apply later this year to run their exchange in 2015 , an option that will remain available in succeeding years , Mr. Cohen said .

                                                                                                                                            The backbone of President Obama’s health care law is taking shape, with 26 states choosing to let the federal government run the online insurance markets mandated by his signature reforms instead of keeping the job in-house or partnering with the feds.\\n\\nThe Department of Health and Human Services had encouraged states to run their own markets, or “exchanges,” that help the uninsured find coverage. Only 17 states and the District took on the task while seven states decided to split the duties, according to a breakdown by the Kaiser Family Foundation.\\n\\nThe exchanges, which are designed to let those without employer-based insurance compare and buy plans with the help of tax credits, are a crucial part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act that passed in 2010 and was largely upheld by the Supreme Court in June. States that wanted to run a partnership exchange with the federal government had to let HHS know by late Friday, ending months or even years of debate among governors and state lawmakers.\\n\\nTheir discussions marked one of two major decisions under “Obamacare.” Whether or not to expand Medicaid within their borders is the other, and it remains a source of contention in state capitals across the country.\\n\\nThe Obama administration says it will be ready to run exchanges in more than half of the states, even though a bevy of Republican governors and lawmakers flouted their intentions by saddling them with the task.\\n\\n“It’s not what the drafters of the bill had hoped would happen,” Timothy S. Jost, a professor at Washington and Lee University School of Law who specializes in health care, said of the outcome on Friday.\\n\\nSEE ALSO: Lost in Spanish translation: ‘Obamacare’ ‘exchanges’ now ‘marketplaces’\\n\\nState leaders who deferred to the federal government cited numerous reasons for their choices; among them, they wanted to distance themselves from Mr. Obama’s first-term achievement, could not obtain enough information to make an informed decision or ran out of time after Mitt Romney lost the presidential election. That loss effectively ended Republicans’ hopes of repealing the health care law.\\n\\nNew Jersey Gov. Chris Christie sent a letter to HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius on Friday to confirm his previously stated preference for a federally run exchange.\\n\\nWest Virginia, meanwhile, applied for a partnership exchange “to retain our ability to assist consumers and maintain our traditional authority to regulate health insurance” in the state, said Jeremiah Samples, an official at the West Virginia Insurance Commission. He said that after months of analysis, officials decided that a state-run exchange would not be worth it because of the state’s relatively small market and the hefty information-technology costs associated with the exchange.\\n\\nFrom the start, HHS advised states to run the exchanges so they could tailor them to their residents’ needs. But the majority said no.\\n\\nMr. Jost said the tilt toward federally run exchanges may help officials in Washington stay on the same page during the early stages of implementation because the marketplaces rely on computer networks that will share data among several federal agencies.\\n\\n“It’s not a particularly bad thing at this point to be doing it this way,” Mr. Jost said.\\n\\nFederal health officials declined to comment on the states’ decisions before midnight Friday, making it unlikely they will weigh in on the spectrum of exchanges until this week.\\n\\nThe Obama administration is striking an optimistic tone less than eight months before enrollment begins, despite the burden of implementation.\\n\\n“We are making great progress, we are on track, and we will be ready for people all across the country to obtain high-quality affordable health care coverage beginning on Oct. 1,” Gary Cohen, director of the Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight, told the Senate Finance Committee on Thursday.\\n\\nStates that deferred can change their minds and apply later this year to run their exchange in 2015, an option that will remain available in succeeding years, Mr. Cohen said.\\n\\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\\n\\nCopyright © 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.

Mccarthy, John Mccormack, Michael Brendan Dougherty, Mairead Mcardle, Robert Verbruggen, Carrie Severino, Tobias Hoonhout, Rich Lowry  Then-FBI Director James Comey testifying on Capitol Hill in 2015 . ( Joshua Roberts/Reuters )\\nA free society can not stay free for long if the criminal-justice system becomes a political weapon , if that becomes our norm .\\nThe most alarming aspect of the Trump–Russia investigation , and of the stark difference between the aggression with which it was pursued and the see-no-evil passivity of the Clinton emails caper , is the way the investigative process was used to influence political outcomes .\\nThe way to right that wrong is to prevent it from becoming the new normal , not to turn the tables of abuse when power shifts from one side to the other . We can only make things worse by losing the distinction between rebuking errors in judgment and criminalizing them .\\nArdent Trump supporters are growling over news that the FBI ’ s former director , James Comey , will not be prosecuted by the Justice Department for the mishandling of memoranda he wrote about his contacts with the president . The news has been reported by The Hill ’ s John Solomon and the Washington Post ’ s Devlin Barrett , among others .\\nComey ’ s handling of his memos is one aspect of probes related to investigations attendant to the 2016 election , which are being conducted by Justice Department independent counsel Michael Horowitz . Indications are that Horowitz referred the memos issue to the Justice Department for possible prosecution and that , after reviewing the IG ’ s findings , Justice declined to pursue the matter as a criminal case .\\nThat is the way things are supposed to work . The inspector general ’ s job is to ensure that colorable allegations of misconduct against Justice Department officials ( including FBI officials ) are thoroughly examined , so that all of the relevant facts are uncovered . The Justice Department then reviews the IG ’ s report , mindful of two imperatives that are in tension . On one hand , clear criminal misconduct must be prosecuted ; otherwise we have a two-tiered justice system in which those we trust to enforce the law can violate it with impunity . On the other hand , poor judgment , while it should be censured and may be the basis for disciplinary action , must not be criminalized ; otherwise , we discourage talented , honorable people from taking jobs that are all about excruciating judgment calls .\\nWhat happened in this instance ? We don ’ t know yet — and that alone calls for restraint . It is no knock on Messrs. Solomon and Barrett , who are excellent reporters with good sources , to caution that we have not yet seen the IG report .\\nTo be sure , many relevant facts are known . The Comey memos have been public for some time , the former director has testified about them in congressional hearings , and they were part of the mountain of information from which Special Counsel Robert Mueller ’ s staff derived their final report . Still , there is much we do not know . Past experience informs us that IG Horowitz is thorough and careful . His office has interviewed lots of witnesses and scrutinized government reports to which we do not have access . His report is not expected to be released until September . Until then , we won ’ t know what happened , and why . In the meantime , since I have known both Attorney General Bill Barr and former director Jim Comey for many years , I am confident about two things .\\nFirst , no one is better suited than Barr to weigh the pros and cons of prosecuting alleged government misconduct . He has prioritized the importance of resisting the politicization of law enforcement and he grasps the stakes involved . He is also a big enough boy to tune out the noise from the Trump–Comey feud : the president ’ s nonstop depiction of Comey as the reincarnation of Lavrentiy Beria , and the former director ’ s worn-thin moralizing about how “ Trump eats your soul in small bites ” — including Barr ’ s own . The attorney general is not going to authorize a prosecution in the absence of clear evidence of a serious crime .\\nSecond , I do not believe that Jim Comey would willfully leak classified information . Unless and until someone can show me he did it , I am going to continue assuming he did not .\\nThat does not mean his handling of the memos was model behavior , though . It seems to me that he played with fire .\\nThe existence of the memos became known shortly after Comey was fired on May 9 , 2017 . It is only natural that they raised alarm . One would expect that if a president and an FBI director met several times , memos documenting those conversations would contain at least some classified information . Comey , moreover , brazenly acknowledged that he had orchestrated the leak of at least a portion of one memo to the New York Times . That is not normal .\\nNevertheless , Comey is very smart . And you don ’ t have to agree with his politics or like his style to realize that he has spent much of his career protecting national security . By definition , when information is classified , that means its unauthorized disclosure could damage American national security . Might Comey mishandle classified information ? Sure , it ’ s possible — plenty of smart , patriotic public officials have done that . But to me , it is implausible that Comey would knowingly do that , much less intentionally transmit classified intelligence to the media .\\nWe know that Comey shared this memo with a friend ( who is also a friend of mine , and who was his intermediary with the Times ) , and that he shared at least some of the memos with his lawyers ( who are also friends of mine ) . From a classified-information standpoint , however , we are talking about a small number of documents , and it is unclear that Comey knew anything in them was classified . Even if he turned out to be wrong about that , it is highly unlikely that prosecutors could prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he was grossly negligent in mishandling them , much less that he willfully mishandled them .\\nTo my mind , the issue here has never been criminal misconduct in connection with classified information . The relevant matters are the non-criminal but serious impropriety in the handling of non-public government information , and the failure to protect the confidentiality of communications as to which the president has a presumptive privilege — a privilege that subordinate executive officials are obliged to respect , regardless of whether they respect the president himself .\\nThere is no problem with Comey ’ s having chosen to write the memos . Much is made of the fact that he did not trust President Trump and that he felt compelled to document their communications , even though he did not do that when he spoke with President Obama . So what ? He is entitled to feel that way . He was under no duty either to write or to refrain from writing memos . As long as he recorded events fairly and honestly when he chose to report them , nothing more was required .\\nThe problem , however , is that the former director seems to have regarded the memos as his own property , rather than the government ’ s . To the contrary , these were clearly accounts of government business compiled by a government official using government property on government time . The memos were not Comey ’ s to keep ; and they were certainly not his to disseminate to the media .\\nReports of non-public government business are sensitive , regardless of whether they contain classified information . Conversations between the president and top national-security officials are among the most sensitive . Top executive officers , such as the FBI director , are well aware that those communications are presumptively privileged , and that the privilege belongs to the president . The director can be cut some slack for keeping memos he wrote in his home rather than in his office — an FBI director is never off duty . But he ’ s got no business leaking government files of any kind to the media , and that goes double for memoranda about communications with the president — any president , end of story .\\nIt makes no difference that , at the time of the leak , Comey was no longer the FBI director . A public official , particularly of such high rank , has continuing fiduciary duties upon leaving government service — even when the departure is against his will . Of course it was wrong for the administration to give conflicting rationales for Comey ’ s firing . It was also wrong for the president to goad the former director with a farcical , shades-of-Watergate tweet , suggesting there might be White House recordings of their conversations . There are many ways the former director could appropriately have responded to these provocations ; leaking a government memo was not one of them .\\nComey has said he was hoping to trigger the appointment of a special counsel . But he could have done that , in his new capacity as a private citizen , by arranging a press conference at which he called for the appointment of a special counsel . It would have gotten plenty of attention . Comey , a gifted public speaker , would have made a forceful presentation that would have gotten significant traction on Capitol Hill , where Democrats were already clamoring for a special counsel .\\nThe former director ’ s decision to proceed by leaking to the media a government memo , documenting a sensitive but probably not classified meeting with the president , was wrong . It was the kind of behavior it is impossible to imagine that Comey , as FBI director , would abide if one of his subordinates had done it . Indeed , in Comey ’ s memo about the Flynn conversation , he describes speaking at length with Trump about the menace of leaks , about how they undermine the president ’ s capacity to do his job . He even recounts telling the president that he was “ eager to find leakers and would like to nail one to the door as a message . ”\\nTo leak the memo was unbecoming conduct . It is worthy of censure . That does not make it a felony .\\nThe ongoing Justice Department and congressional inquiries into the investigations attendant to the 2016 election are wide-ranging . In assessing investigative overreach , it is vital to remember that the remedy for politicized law enforcement is not more politicized law enforcement . If officials with a commendable record of service to the country took steps they should not have taken out of lapses in judgment — including lapses driven by overwrought suspicions of impending danger to the nation — then there needs to be an accounting . We will also need to implement better oversight procedures to insure against a repetition .\\nThat , however , does not mean crimes were committed . The president ’ s fans should remember that their main complaint has been that Donald Trump and his campaign were treated as suspects in heinous , traitorous crimes despite the absence of credible incriminating evidence .

(Joshua Roberts/Reuters)\\n\\nTurning the page away from the politicization of investigations\\n\\nA free society cannot stay free for long if the criminal-justice system becomes a political weapon, if that becomes our norm.\\n\\nThe most alarming aspect of the Trump–Russia investigation, and of the stark difference between the aggression with which it was pursued and the see-no-evil passivity of the Clinton emails caper, is the way the investigative process was used to influence political outcomes.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe way to right that wrong is to prevent it from becoming the new normal, not to turn the tables of abuse when power shifts from one side to the other. We can only make things worse by losing the distinction between rebuking errors in judgment and criminalizing them.\\n\\nArdent Trump supporters are growling over news that the FBI’s former director, James Comey, will not be prosecuted by the Justice Department for the mishandling of memoranda he wrote about his contacts with the president. The news has been reported by The Hill’s John Solomon and the Washington Post’s Devlin Barrett, among others.\\n\\nComey’s handling of his memos is one aspect of probes related to investigations attendant to the 2016 election, which are being conducted by Justice Department independent counsel Michael Horowitz. Indications are that Horowitz referred the memos issue to the Justice Department for possible prosecution and that, after reviewing the IG’s findings, Justice declined to pursue the matter as a criminal case.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThat is the way things are supposed to work. The inspector general’s job is to ensure that colorable allegations of misconduct against Justice Department officials (including FBI officials) are thoroughly examined, so that all of the relevant facts are uncovered. The Justice Department then reviews the IG’s report, mindful of two imperatives that are in tension. On one hand, clear criminal misconduct must be prosecuted; otherwise we have a two-tiered justice system in which those we trust to enforce the law can violate it with impunity. On the other hand, poor judgment, while it should be censured and may be the basis for disciplinary action, must not be criminalized; otherwise, we discourage talented, honorable people from taking jobs that are all about excruciating judgment calls.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nWhat happened in this instance? We don’t know yet — and that alone calls for restraint. It is no knock on Messrs. Solomon and Barrett, who are excellent reporters with good sources, to caution that we have not yet seen the IG report.\\n\\nTo be sure, many relevant facts are known. The Comey memos have been public for some time, the former director has testified about them in congressional hearings, and they were part of the mountain of information from which Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s staff derived their final report. Still, there is much we do not know. Past experience informs us that IG Horowitz is thorough and careful. His office has interviewed lots of witnesses and scrutinized government reports to which we do not have access. His report is not expected to be released until September. Until then, we won’t know what happened, and why. In the meantime, since I have known both Attorney General Bill Barr and former director Jim Comey for many years, I am confident about two things.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nFirst, no one is better suited than Barr to weigh the pros and cons of prosecuting alleged government misconduct. He has prioritized the importance of resisting the politicization of law enforcement and he grasps the stakes involved. He is also a big enough boy to tune out the noise from the Trump–Comey feud: the president’s nonstop depiction of Comey as the reincarnation of Lavrentiy Beria, and the former director’s worn-thin moralizing about how “Trump eats your soul in small bites” — including Barr’s own. The attorney general is not going to authorize a prosecution in the absence of clear evidence of a serious crime.\\n\\nSecond, I do not believe that Jim Comey would willfully leak classified information. Unless and until someone can show me he did it, I am going to continue assuming he did not.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThat does not mean his handling of the memos was model behavior, though. It seems to me that he played with fire.\\n\\nThe existence of the memos became known shortly after Comey was fired on May 9, 2017. It is only natural that they raised alarm.

But to me, it is implausible that Comey would knowingly do that, much less intentionally transmit classified intelligence to the media.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThat said, the classified-information facet of this episode has been exaggerated. There were seven memos in all, totaling 15 pages. Our understanding is that Comey tried to avoid putting classified information in them, and believed he had succeeded. Yet after obtaining and accounting for all of them, the FBI designated two of them as “confidential,” the lowest level of classification. We do not know at this point (or, at least, I don’t know) whether the memo leaked to the Times — regarding the February 2017 Trump–Comey discussion of the investigation of former national-security adviser Michael Flynn — was one of the classified ones. But we can easily deduce that Comey neither intended it to be classified nor thought it was. At one point in the memo, Comey wrote, “NOTE: Because this is an unclassified document, I will be limited in how I describe what I said next.”\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nWe know that Comey shared this memo with a friend (who is also a friend of mine, and who was his intermediary with the Times), and that he shared at least some of the memos with his lawyers (who are also friends of mine). From a classified-information standpoint, however, we are talking about a small number of documents, and it is unclear that Comey knew anything in them was classified.

Viewers\\nFox News has repeatedly gone to former Justice Department official Robert Driscoll to comment on the Russia investigations , but what viewers do n't hear is that he 's also the attorney for Maria Butina , the suspected Russian spy charged with criminal counts .\\nCable news programs have been full of commentators talking about the president 's legal problems and the question of possible Russian collusion . One frequent analyst on Fox News has an unusual credential . Robert Driscoll is a lawyer who represents a woman accused of being a Russian spy . But viewers do n't always know about that credential . Here 's NPR 's David Folkenflik .\\nDAVID FOLKENFLIK , BYLINE : The principle at stake was encapsulated pretty neatly back in May by , of all people , Fox News host Laura Ingraham . She was mocking the frequent TV appearances of the attorney for Stormy Daniels , who alleges she was paid during the 2016 campaign to hush up her earlier affair with President Trump .\\nLAURA INGRAHAM : There has been quite a few - have been quite a few mistruths stated by Michael Avenatti , who is brought on to some of these other networks as almost , like , an analyst . They almost forget that he 's representing a client .\\nFOLKENFLIK : Ingraham herself has periodically interviewed Robert Driscoll . He was chief of staff for the Justice Department 's Civil Rights Division under George W. Bush . This year , Driscoll spoke about the president 's legal challenges , including questions of his ties to Russia , the larger investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller , the credibility of the FBI and the prosecution of former Trump campaign chief Paul Manafort .\\nBack in May , Driscoll spoke on Fox News about the hush payments to Trump 's alleged past mistresses .\\nROBERT DRISCOLL : I think you can power through that because the public kind of accepted that . And if he can , you know , keep his eyes on the prize and get exonerated on the Russia stuff , I think he can weather the storm on this .\\nFOLKENFLIK : The Russian stuff - that 's relevant here . Driscoll is defending an accused Russian spy , Maria Butina , against federal charges . If prosecutors are correct , she is very much part of the larger story of Russian interference in the 2016 elections . Those charges became public back in July . Fox interviewed him about the case in subsequent days .\\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON : And coming up in this show , our exclusive interview with the attorney representing accused Russian spy Maria Butina . Robert Driscoll will join us live momentarily .\\nFOLKENFLIK : Yet Driscoll was interviewed at least three more times by Fox News on other matters related to Russia , such as Trump 's withdrawal of security clearance from former CIA Chief John Brennan , whose intense criticism of the president centers on Russia .\\nFox viewers were not told of Driscoll 's role as Butina 's defense attorney . Driscoll tells NPR there 's no conflict because she is being prosecuted by the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia , not Mueller .\\nDRISCOLL : Most of the contact done has been pretty general about the powers of the , you know , special counsel and , yeah , how long things take and those type of general questions . And Maria 's case was not - it did n't overlap with any of those .\\nSID BEDINGFIELD : Once he took the job as her lawyer , his status changed .\\nFOLKENFLIK : Sid Bedingfield is former executive vice president of CNN .\\nBEDINGFIELD : He 's no longer an independent observer , but someone with a vested interest in the larger story of Russian engagement with the U.S. election process . And therefore , a news organization owes it to its readers and viewers to identify specifically what role he 's playing in the larger story .\\nFOLKENFLIK : Fox did not know initially of Driscoll 's role . He tells NPR he represented Butina as far back as February , when the Senate Intelligence Committee first sought her testimony in private . Driscoll says he only told news outlets of his involvement in July . Yet , he appeared several times as an analyst without Fox disclosing that to its viewers .\\nFox News ' top programming executive tells NPR the network is now reminding producers of its aim to make all relevant disclosures .

Fox News Hasn't Always Shared Robert Driscoll's Credentials With Its Viewers\\n\\nFox News has repeatedly gone to former Justice Department official Robert Driscoll to comment on the Russia investigations, but what viewers don't hear is that he's also the attorney for Maria Butina, the suspected Russian spy charged with criminal counts.\\n\\nARI SHAPIRO, HOST:\\n\\nCable news programs have been full of commentators talking about the president's legal problems and the question of possible Russian collusion. One frequent analyst on Fox News has an unusual credential. Robert Driscoll is a lawyer who represents a woman accused of being a Russian spy. But viewers don't always know about that credential. Here's NPR's David Folkenflik.\\n\\nDAVID FOLKENFLIK, BYLINE: The principle at stake was encapsulated pretty neatly back in May by, of all people, Fox News host Laura Ingraham. She was mocking the frequent TV appearances of the attorney for Stormy Daniels, who alleges she was paid during the 2016 campaign to hush up her earlier affair with President Trump.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"MEDIA BUZZ\")\\n\\nLAURA INGRAHAM: There has been quite a few - have been quite a few mistruths stated by Michael Avenatti, who is brought on to some of these other networks as almost, like, an analyst. They almost forget that he's representing a client.\\n\\nFOLKENFLIK: Ingraham herself has periodically interviewed Robert Driscoll. He was chief of staff for the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division under George W. Bush. This year, Driscoll spoke about the president's legal challenges, including questions of his ties to Russia, the larger investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller, the credibility of the FBI and the prosecution of former Trump campaign chief Paul Manafort.\\n\\nBack in May, Driscoll spoke on Fox News about the hush payments to Trump's alleged past mistresses.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"OUTNUMBERED OVERTIME WITH HARRIS FAULKNER\")\\n\\nROBERT DRISCOLL: I think you can power through that because the public kind of accepted that. And if he can, you know, keep his eyes on the prize and get exonerated on the Russia stuff, I think he can weather the storm on this.\\n\\nFOLKENFLIK: The Russian stuff - that's relevant here. Driscoll is defending an accused Russian spy, Maria Butina, against federal charges. If prosecutors are correct, she is very much part of the larger story of Russian interference in the 2016 elections. Those charges became public back in July. Fox interviewed him about the case in subsequent days.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON: And coming up in this show, our exclusive interview with the attorney representing accused Russian spy Maria Butina. Robert Driscoll will join us live momentarily.\\n\\nFOLKENFLIK: Yet Driscoll was interviewed at least three more times by Fox News on other matters related to Russia, such as Trump's withdrawal of security clearance from former CIA Chief John Brennan, whose intense criticism of the president centers on Russia.\\n\\nFox viewers were not told of Driscoll's role as Butina's defense attorney. Driscoll tells NPR there's no conflict because she is being prosecuted by the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, not Mueller.\\n\\nDRISCOLL: Most of the contact done has been pretty general about the powers of the, you know, special counsel and, yeah, how long things take and those type of general questions. And Maria's case was not - it didn't overlap with any of those.\\n\\nFOLKENFLIK: Not everyone agrees.\\n\\nSID BEDINGFIELD: Once he took the job as her lawyer, his status changed.\\n\\nFOLKENFLIK: Sid Bedingfield is former executive vice president of CNN.\\n\\nBEDINGFIELD: He's no longer an independent observer, but someone with a vested interest in the larger story of Russian engagement with the U.S. election process. And therefore, a news organization owes it to its readers and viewers to identify specifically what role he's playing in the larger story.\\n\\nFOLKENFLIK: Fox did not know initially of Driscoll's role. He tells NPR he represented Butina as far back as February, when the Senate Intelligence Committee first sought her testimony in private. Driscoll says he only told news outlets of his involvement in July. Yet, he appeared several times as an analyst without Fox disclosing that to its viewers.\\n\\nFox News' top programming executive tells NPR the network is now reminding producers of its aim to make all relevant disclosures.

end to the U.S.-China trade war when both sides meet in Washington next week , saying the world ’ s two largest economies are a long way from resolving their differences .\\n“ We ’ re miles and miles from getting a resolution , ” he said in an interview on CNBC on Thursday . “ Trade is very complicated . There are lots and lots of issues . ”\\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average and S & P 500 Index traded lower after the secretary ’ s remarks , before erasing losses .\\nChinese Vice Premier Liu He is scheduled to visit Washington from Jan. 30-31 to meet U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer .\\n“ People shouldn ’ t think that the events of next week are going to be the solution to all of the issues between the United States and China . It ’ s too complicated a topic , ” Ross said . “ I believe that China would like to make a deal . I believe that we would like to make a deal . But it has to be a deal that works for both parties . ”\\nRoss added that he sees a “ fair chance we do get to a deal ” eventually .\\nWhite House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said the conversations with Liu ’ s team next week will be a crucial test of whether the two sides can come to an agreement .\\n“ The Liu He talks will be determinative , ” Kudlow told Fox News on Thursday , adding that Trump has told him that he remains “ rather optimistic . ”\\n“ The scope of the talks are huge and the talks are going to continue at the highest level , ” said Kudlow . Right now “ we have nothing on paper , there is no contract , there is no deal . ”\\nThe comments from the senior Trump administration officials come with just over five weeks to go before a deadline to conclude a deal . If that doesn ’ t happen , the Trump administration has threatened to raise the tariff rate on $ 200 billion in Chinese good to 25 percent from 10 percent .\\nWhile the two sides appear to be in close contact as the deadline approaches , it ’ s also apparent that there ’ s some way to go before they resolve their differences . Investors have been jittery this week about the prospects of a deal , as news trickled out that substantial differences remain , including a ███ News report that the governments are struggling to bridge the gap on intellectual-property issues .\\nThe IMF this week downgraded its global outlook for the second time in three months , warning of mounting risks including an escalation of the trade

There are lots and lots of issues.”\\n\\nWilbur Ross Photographer: Joshua Roberts/Bloomberg\\n\\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 Index traded lower after the secretary’s remarks, before erasing losses.\\n\\nChinese Vice Premier Liu He is scheduled to visit Washington from Jan. 30-31 to meet U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer.\\n\\nLiu He Photographer: Jason Alden/Bloomberg\\n\\n“People shouldn’t think that the events of next week are going to be the solution to all of the issues between the United States and China. It’s too complicated a topic,” Ross said. “I believe that China would like to make a deal. I believe that we would like to make a deal. But it has to be a deal that works for both parties.”\\n\\nState of Play: U.S.-China Trade Negotiations Near Next Round\\n\\nRoss added that he sees a “fair chance we do get to a deal” eventually.\\n\\nWhite House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said the conversations with Liu’s team next week will be a crucial test of whether the two sides can come to an agreement.\\n\\n“The Liu He talks will be determinative,” Kudlow told Fox News on Thursday, adding that Trump has told him that he remains “rather optimistic.”\\n\\nLarry Kudlow Photographer: Alex Edelman/Bloomberg\\n\\n“The scope of the talks are huge and the talks are going to continue at the highest level,” said Kudlow. Right now “we have nothing on paper, there is no contract, there is no deal.”\\n\\nThe comments from the senior Trump administration officials come with just over five weeks to go before a deadline to conclude a deal. If that doesn’t happen, the Trump administration has threatened to raise the tariff rate on $200 billion in Chinese good to 25 percent from 10 percent.\\n\\nWhile the two sides appear to be in close contact as the deadline approaches, it’s also apparent that there’s some way to go before they resolve their differences. Investors have been jittery this week about the prospects of a deal, as news trickled out that substantial differences remain, including a Bloomberg News report that the governments are struggling to bridge the gap on intellectual-property issues.\\n\\nThe IMF this week downgraded its global outlook for the second time in three months, warning of mounting risks including an escalation of the trade war and tightening credit.        www.bloomberg.com    center  ZW7MmqXMtiJgL6jY\n"
